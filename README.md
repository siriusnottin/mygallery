# My Gallery

*A project inspired by the [JavaScript for WordPress Workshop 2020](https://github.com/siriusnottin/jsforwp-conf-workshop-2020).*

## What is this

This website will resume the day by only three pictures, in ascending order.

## What I used

I used my actual knowledge in development and that I acquired by the workshop on the first day with HTML, CSS (SASS) and JavaScript.

This is my first project using React.

### The web design

I made the [interface with Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/E3dKgosEeflZCEPVOkWIbr9Y/jsforwp-conf-workshop-2020?node-id=1%3A2) and the animations was designed [using ProtoPie](https://share.protopie.io/aiVA4d3StFW).

## Roadmap

These are the modifications I want to apply to my project in the near future:

- Use of React
- Create a WordPress plugin
- Instead of using fake pictures, use an [real API](https://api.ap.org/media/v/docs/api/) to automatically grab actual pictures.
- Build the newsletter for real
- Optimize the code
- Any suggestions?
